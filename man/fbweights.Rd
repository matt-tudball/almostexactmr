\usage{
forward_backward_weights(PHap, CHap, dist, epsilon = 1e-08)
}
\arguments{
\item{PHap}{Named list of parental haplotypes which must be of the form
\code{list(m=, f=)}.\code{m} is a (0,1)-matrix of maternally-inherited haplotypes and
\code{f} is a (0,1)-matrix of paternally-inherited haplotypes. Each row corresponds
to an offspring and each column is a SNP.}

\item{CHap}{(0,1)-matrix of offspring haplotypes. Each row corresponds
to an offspring and each column is a SNP.}

\item{epsilon}{De novo mutation rate (default is 1e-8)}

\item{d}{Vector of genetic distances corresponding to haplotypes in PHap and CHap}
}

Named list of forward-backward weights
